# Contribution Guidelines

It's great that you decided to contribute! Before you make an awesome submission, please read the guidelines carefully.

## Guidelines:

- CLI is free and open source.
- Tool's main goal is to be used in the terminal, e.g. `rspec` has CLI but it's predominantly a testing framework.
- A tool is actively used and maintained, e.g. recent releases and significant download numbers.
- The entries follow a pattern: `[name](URL) - Brief description that ends with a full stop.`
- The name should match, if possible, the `rubygems.org` published gem name and not the stylised project name.
- The URL should link, when possible, to a source code repository with documentation.
- Avoid starting description with `A/An/The` and instead use third-person form, e.i. `Provides access to...`.
- Prefer brevity. Write description that explains the tool's purpose most succinctly.
- Don't mention `command-line`, `terminal`, `CLI` in the description as they're implied.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Preserve alphabetical ordering of the entries.
- Check if your entry doesn't already exist.

Thank you for your contribution!
